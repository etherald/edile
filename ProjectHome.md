Edile is a basic but useful text editor for Linux, Mac OSX and other unix-like operating systems. Written in Python, Edile is implemented in a single source code file and requires no installation - you simply execute the source code file. Edile requires Python, PyGtk and if you have GtkSourceView installed it will use that for syntax highlighting, line numbering and other things. Edile is something between a script and an app - You can pipe text into it to create a new document, use a plugin file loaded locally or over the network to execute custom functions on your document
