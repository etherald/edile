= Introduction =

Edile is a basic but useful text editor intended for system administration and scripting.
 



= Details =

Edile can open text from stdin or a pipe and display it in a window for perusal or editing. I couldn't find *any* graphical linux editors that did this (it's common on the Mac) so I wrote Edile. It's since grown into a pretty decent editor (IMO) and I actually find myself actually using it. It is implemented in a single python source code file and requires no installation beyond that.
