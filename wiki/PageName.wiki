Edile is a basic but useful text editor intended for system administration and scripting.
 



= Details =

Edile can open text from stdin or a pipe and display it in a window for perusal or editing. I couldn't find *any* graphical linux editors that did this (it's common on the Mac) so I wrote Edile. It's since grown into a pretty decent editor (IMO) and I actually find myself actually using it when I could be using, oh, geany or leafpad which are the other two editors I use. For a pure command line editor I like ne. LXDE is my desktop environment and Debian Sid is my distribution of choice. It (Edile, not Debian) is implemented in a single python source code file and requires no installation beyond that. Plugins can be loaded from a http://, file:/// or other url and can be turned off entirely. Edile can open a default file on startup, making it into a quick notepad type program. Edile blurs the line between script and application, integrating closely with the command line while maintaining a full, modern graphical environment. You can use it as your $EDITOR
